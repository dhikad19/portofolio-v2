      <p class="about-description">
        I’m a front-end developer passionate about creating clean, accessible, and visually engaging websites. 
        With a keen eye for detail and a focus on user experience, I bring designs to life through responsive and pixel-perfect code. 
        Always striving to stay ahead of trends, I’m dedicated to crafting seamless, intuitive digital experiences for users across all devices.

      <p class="about-description">
        I work closely with designers, back-end developers, and clients to deliver high-quality solutions that not only meet project requirements but exceed expectations. 
        Whether it's optimizing performance, ensuring accessibility, or integrating innovative features, I approach each project with a problem-solving mindset and a commitment to continuous improvement. 
        My goal is to make the web a better place, one line of code at a time.
      </p>
      <p class="about-description">
        I am always eager to learn and grow, keeping up with the latest front-end technologies like 
        <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/" target="_blank">Vue</a>, and CSS frameworks, as well as best practices in web performance and accessibility. 
        I'm also expanding my skill set to include back-end technologies like <a href="https://nodejs.org/en" target="_blank">Node.js</a>, aiming to become a well-rounded developer. 
        My passion for coding is matched only by my desire to create products that are not just functional, but enjoyable for users to interact with. Each project I undertake is an opportunity to push the boundaries of what’s possible on the web.

      <p class="about-description">
        Outside of coding, you’ll find me grinding in Rift, farm some items in Genshin, binge-watching my favorite anime, or diving into a good book. 
        These activities help me unwind and spark my creativity, giving me fresh ideas and new perspectives that I bring into my work.
